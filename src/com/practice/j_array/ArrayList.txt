                                                            ::Array List::

Problem Statement:-

*   Consider we don't know the actual size of the array.
*   So we used to tell the Java to manage the space of the array and I will enter the values.
*   This action is been done by ArrayLists.
*   ArrayLists has been found in java.util.package.
*   This is slower than the standard array.
*   The angular bracket basically shows us about the generics.
SYNTAX:
ArrayList<"DATATYPE"> NAME = new ArrayList<>();
or
ArrayList<"DATATYPE"> NAME = new ArrayList<"DATATYPE">();

EXAMPLE:
ArrayList<Integer> sat = new ArrayList<Integer>();
